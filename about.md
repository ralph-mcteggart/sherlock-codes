My name is **Ralph McTeggart** and I'm a software engineer from [Belfast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast), Ireland. 

I consider myself a full stack dev, although my professional background is mostly in back-end distributed systems. I will develop in whatever solves the problem. Actually, sometimes the problem is the most interesting bit. 

The blog will probably contain various musings around:

+ Rust
+ Linux
+ Vim
+ GraphQL
+ Distributed systems
+ People problems in software
+ Security
+ Open source
+ Java / Kotlin
+ Various other languages
+ AWS
+ whatever else I'm working on...

*Thank you for reading!*
